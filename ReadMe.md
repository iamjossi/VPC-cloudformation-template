Description: VPC with Public and Private Subnets

This CloudFormation template creates a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in Amazon Web Services (AWS) along with the necessary resources for networking and subnetting. The template defines two public subnets, two private application subnets, and two private database subnets, distributed across different Availability Zones to enhance fault tolerance and availability.
